Research Experience
===================

<span>**Tools for Motif Conservation Analysis, PhD Project**</span>\
*Guide: <span>Prof. Anton Valouev</span>* *<span>Dept. of Preventive
Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, USC</span>*\
Motif analysis of ChIP-Seq datasets often reports multiple motifs.
However, determining the quality of a reported motif is hard. Motifs
predicted by motif discovery tools can often not be the ‘true motifs’
and can have significant p-value(or E-values) for even ‘false motifs’.
We hypothesized that, a ‘true motif’ should exhibit high evolutionary
conservation scores. MoCA makes use of the PhyloP and Gerp scores to
assess the conservation profile of the motif bases and compares it with
flanking bases and by searching for motifs in random genomic regions. We
performed analysis on various ENCODE Chip-Seq datasets and found that
the ‘true motifs’, validated experimentally do exhibit high conservation
scores.

MoCA is available as a web service at <http://moca.usc.edu>

***<span>Awarded Outstanding Thesis Award</span>***\
Cancer is a disease known to be affected by mutations. These mutations
however may not all be significant. Distinguishing driver mutations from
passengers is a non-trivial problem. The current methods are either
focused on functional pathway analysis or machine learning. We developed
a Galaxy based toolbox to run multiple such prediction tools at once,
thus removing the need to convert data formats, in a reproducible
manner. The end results were displayed as a heatmap, to give an insight
into those mutations which are predicted to be drivers, by all the
tools, thus possibly reducing the set of mutations to the ‘real’
drivers.

We also analysed Proteomics data ................................. We
use Correspondence Analysis and recursive feature elimination to predict
a smaller set of marker genes that can be used to differentiate marker
genes of Glioblastoma.

**Automated Mining of Reaction Patterns**\
*Guide: <span>Dr. Syed Asad Rahman</span>*\
EC-BLAST is a novel tool to compare enzymes and map reactions. I used
Machine Learning(clustering) based approaches to point out misclassified
enzymes in the established classification system. I also developed a
RESTful web-service to allow automated job submissions that would allow
the users to keep track of all submitted jobs and retrieve results on
demand.

**Next Generation Sequencing, Supervised Learning Project**\
*Guide: <span>Prof. Santosh Noronha</span>* *<span>Dept. of Chemical
Engineering, IIT Bombay</span>*\
This project was in collaboration with Advanced Centre for Treatment,
Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC). Surveyed literature on Next
Generation Sequencing techniques and developed automated pipelines using
Python to analyze whole genome data of cancer tumors. As part of the
project I contributed open source modules for BWA and samtools for
Biopython, a Python based open source library for bioinformatics.

**Scilab On Cloud**\
*Guide: <span>Prof. Kannan Moudagalya</span>*

Scilab is an open source software for numerical computation and is
primarily command line/GUI based. We developed a back end that allowed
running Scilab through browser much like the modern day IPython
notebooks.
